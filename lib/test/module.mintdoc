This module provides classes allowing the implementation of unit tests. The main classes are {Test.Suite} which schedule implemented tests and {Test.Case} which is a base class for implementing a new set of tests.

A test project is composed of a set of tests cases and an entry-point that schedule the tests.

**Example**:
```mn
load test.suite
load mint.lang
load my-test
load my-other-test

if isMain() {
    Test.Suite.instance().run()
}
```
